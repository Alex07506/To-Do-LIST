## 4. Technical Components --- Declaration

###  4.1 Open Source Libraries Used
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python. [License: BSD](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: An extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy. [License: BSD](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/)
- **PyMySQL**: A pure-Python MySQL client library. [License: MIT](https://pymysql.readthedocs.io/)

### 4.2 Third-Party Resources
No third-party resources outside of the Python ecosystem were used in this project.

### 4.3 Custom Code
All other parts of the application, including the logic for handling HTTP requests, interacting with the database, and rendering templates, were developed independently.

---
##  5. Algorithm
The application uses basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage the tasks stored in a MySQL database. The following algorithms are implemented:
1. **Task Creation**: Add new tasks with a title and default status (`completed=False`).
2. **Task Retrieval**: Fetch all tasks from the database, sorted by creation time in descending order.
3. **Task Update**: Modify task attributes such as title or completion status.
4. **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks permanently from the database.
5. **Task Toggle**: Switch the completion status (`completed`) of a task between `True` and `False`.

---

##  6. Current Status (Week 5)
- **Status**: Fully functional and tested.
- **Features**:
  - Web Interface: Users can interact with the app via HTML forms.
  - RESTful API: Developers can programmatically interact with the app using JSON-based API endpoints.
  - Database Integration: Tasks are stored in a MySQL database for persistence.
-   **Key Functions**:
     -  1. Create a Task
At the top of the page, there's an input form where users can enter the title of a new task. Once submitted, the task is added to the list with a default status of incomplete.
      - 2. Toggle Task Completion
Each task is accompanied by a checkbox. Users can click to mark a task as complete or revert it to incomplete.
This interaction is handled instantly using AJAX, without requiring a page reload.
    - 3. Delete a Task
Every task entry has a “Delete” button. Clicking it removes the task both from the page and from the database in real time.
This responsive interface is enhanced with Bootstrap 5, ensuring compatibility across different screen sizes and devices
- **Known Issues**: None at the moment.

 – DB replication lag (<200ms)  

## 11. Purpose of the software 
### We choose Agile software development process
---
### Why Agile (vs. Waterfall)

### 1. Precise Response to Evolving Requirements  
In a tool-type application like a Todo List, users often request new interaction features (e.g., task tags, file attachments). Through bi-weekly sprints, we achieved:  

- **Sprint 1**: Rapid delivery of core CRUD functionality to validate feasibility  
- **Sprint 3**: Addition of task-priority feature (Urgent/Important) based on user feedback  
- Dynamic task ordering via Trello board to prioritize high-value requirements  

**Example**:  
While developing the RESTful API, JSON support was the original plan. Based on community feedback, CSV export functionality was added within 24 hours during Sprint 

### 2. Early Exposure of Technical Risks  
**Protective Mechanism**: For critical risk points such as database operations and API concurrency, agile practice provides early feedback loops. For example, after Sprint 1, daily automated builds run on every commit via GitHub Actions:  
-``` name: Run Pytest|
     run: |
    |pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=xml```
 
### 3. Efficient Cross-Functional Team Collaboration  
**Collaboration Model**: For front-end/back-end separation, the agile toolchain is key. For example, front-end (Harry) and back-end (HAO) worked in parallel using the OpenAPI spec, reducing idle time.

---
### **Possible Usage & Target Market:**

-   **Individual Users:** Students and freelancers who need a lightweight web app to manage their daily to‑do items.
    
-   **Small Team Collaboration:** Project teams that require shared task lists and asynchronous status updates.
    
-   **Educational & Prototyping:** As a Flask‑based tutorial example or early prototype for teaching, research, hackathons, and similar scenarios.
